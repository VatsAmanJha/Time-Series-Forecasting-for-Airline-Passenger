## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krishnaik06/Live-Time-Series/main/airline_passengers.csv). It consists of monthly counts of airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- Plotly
- PyLab

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels plotly
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/time-series-analysis.git](https://github.com/VatsAmanJha/Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Airline-Passenger)
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the time series analysis code.

## Results

The analysis includes the following key insights:

- Identification of non-stationarity in the data.
- Visualization of rolling mean and standard deviation.
- Seasonal patterns analysis.
- Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- Implementation of ARIMA and SARIMA models for forecasting..
